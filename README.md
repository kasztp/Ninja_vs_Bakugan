## Ninja fights Bakugan swarm.


My first game experiment with pygame.

The idea came from my younger son: as he really likes Ninjago and Bakugan, and endless runner games, I promised to create a game for him with some of his favourite characters. This gave me motivation to try pygame and try myself in gadeveloping a game.

Fun fact: The last time I did something similar I was about 8 or 10 and it was on a Commodore Plus/4 in BASIC. :)
